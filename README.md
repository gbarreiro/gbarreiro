- **Data Engineering**: ETL workflows (*Apache Airflow, Apache Spark*), data analysis (*Apache Spark, Pandas*), data visualization (*Matplotlib, Redash, Metabase*), Machine Learning (*scikit-learn*).
- **Data Storage**: Relational databases (*MySQL*) and non-relational (*MongoDB*). Data lakes (*Delta Lake, Apache Hadoop and HDFS*).
- **Backend**: REST APIs design (*Flask, Node.js + Express, Swagger*). Docker and Linux. Basics on AWS and Azure.
- **Frontend**: iOS, Android and Angular.
